Homework 4
Naga Nithin Manne
Advanced C++ (MPCS 51045)

This Homework was done using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
Each part of the assignment is a project in the solution.
Please use Visual Studio or MSBuild to compile the solution.
I have also added a Makefile that compiles all the .cpp files
using g++ with C++17.

This homework uses the Boost C++ Library. Please make sure to
install it. If using Visual Studio, NuGet should install it
automatically.

Toolchains/Dependencies Used:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Ver. 16.5.4
2. Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Ver. 14.25
3. Boost Ver. 1.72.0
