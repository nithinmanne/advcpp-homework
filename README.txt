Homework 8
Naga Nithin Manne
Advanced C++ (MPCS 51045)

This Homework was done using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
Each part of the assignment is a project in the solution.
Please use Visual Studio or MSBuild to compile the solution.

Because of the dependencies, I have used Visual Studio to
correctly link and execute them, and the Makefile will not work.

Files Changed in xmlDataBind:
1. homework1-xmlDataBind/struct_formatter.h
2. homework1-xmlDataBind/serializer_decl_formatter.h
3. homework1-xmlDataBind/xmlbind.h

I have not included any note.h files, as they are autogenerated.
These files will be generated as part of a post build action
for homework1-xmlDataBind. All other homeworks depend on this
as per the project file, so building any homework will actually
generate these files, without any other input. Also note that,
only homework3 runs without any arguments, and the remaining
will not run without specifying the note.xml file. Also, other
dependencies including Boost are included using NuGet, and this
solution will work without any other dependencies.

Toolchains/Dependencies Used:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Ver. 16.5.4
2. Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Ver. 14.25
