Final Project 
Naga Nithin Manne
Advanced C++ (MPCS 51045)


My Project is a Simple Library Management System.
It supports Registering and Logging in as a Student
or Admin. Admins can add books from csv files. I have
added one file (bookslist.csv) to test. Students can
search for books by name or author's name using regex.

I have tried to use different techniques to implement
each operation which let me apply many of the techniques
we learnt during the course.

N.B.: I have done this project giving more preference
to the amount of different programming techniques
rather than the actual functionality of the code.

Sample Usage:
1. Create an Admin Account
2. Login to the created Admin account
3. Add books from the bookslist.csv file
4. Create a Student Account
5. Login to the created Student account
6. Search by Book Name for C\+\+ (\+ because regex)

This Homework was done using Microsoft Visual Studio IDE.
Each part of the assignment is a project in the solution.
Please use Visual Studio or MSBuild to compile the solution.
I have also added a Makefile that compiles all the .cpp files
using g++ with C++17.

Toolchains/Dependencies Used:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 Ver. 16.6.2
2. Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Ver. 14.26
