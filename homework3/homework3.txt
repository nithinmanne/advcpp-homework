As expected CTRE performs much faster than std::regex, getting upto almost 10 times
the speed. This is probably due to the fact that all the regex code is generated at
compile time, rather than interpreted during execution. However, this has an extremely
noticable difference in the time taken to compile. When using only regex, the compilation
happens almost immediately, but with CTRE, it takes upto 5 seconds to compile. Also,
the documentation for std::regex is more thorough and it has more features as compared
to CTRE, which makes std::regex easier to use.
