An invariant for it could be:
Any dynamically allocated memory should only be maintained
using smart pointers. This makes it so that there can not
be any memory leaks since all allocated memory will have
references to it.

Some Other Invariants Are:
For Vector:
The capacity is always greater than the actual size of vector.
This can prevent buffer overflows.
For Linked List:
Don't free a blocks memory before deleting all references to it.
This makes it so none of the blocks point to freed memory.
